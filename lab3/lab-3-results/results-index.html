        <h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
        <p>The goal of this lab was to further progress our knowledge of html local files</p>
        <h2>The difficulties I encountered happened when I tried to apply CSS to the markup file and when linking an image as well. At first I was putting the CSS in the the actual html file, but then I realized I needed to put it into the CSS doc, but for some reason it still did not work. Similarly I tried to link my portrait, but when I loaded the file on my browser it would only show the "image" icon, not the actual portrait. For both of these problems I tried to go over the notes and went to w3school for help, but to no avail. My partner had to leave early from the peer typing, so I was left to my own devices.</h2>
